### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer with experience at all levels of the stack. I've spent the last ~year working at Industry Star, where I've been working on software empowering supply chains. My contributions have entailed UI/UX improvements, product design, feature implementation, bug squashing, tooling upgrades, and more, all done with an Angular frontend hooked up to a ASP.NET backend with a SQL Server database, Cosmos database, and elastic search data store.

Currently working my way through the full stack open course. React is great. I wish I could use it at work.

Contact me via email or Twitter.
