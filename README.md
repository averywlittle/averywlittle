### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer with experience at all levels of the stack. I've spent the last ~year working at Industry Star, where I've been working on software empowering supply chains. My contributions have entailed UI/UX improvements, product design, feature implementation, bug squashing, tooling upgrades, and more, all done with an Angular frontend hooked up to a ASP.NET backend with a MySQL database, CosmosDB data store, and elastic search data store.

Recently I've been learning React and MongoDB. NoSQL databases are ideal for learning new technologies since they are simple to set up and easy to change. I built www.tweetsort.io (code in a repo pinned here) using my new capabilities in React. My next project will use React, Typescript, testing frameworks, another node and express backend, and a postgres database.

Code for my projects can be found here. Contact me via email or twitter.

And check out my substack for explorations in building and learning.
